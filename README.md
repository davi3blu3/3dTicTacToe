# 3D Tic Tac Toe 

This project is my solution to the freeCodeCamp's Advanced Front End Development Projects found at https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game. It was designed using jQuery and CSS animations.  The requirements were to fulfill the following user stories:

### User Story #1:
I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.

### User Story #2:
User Story: My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.

### User Story #3:
User Story: I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

## Installing

You can fork or clone this repo and run it locally on your computer by opening the file path in your browser.  It will run statically in a local browser or can be served using MAMP as I did in my local environment.
